# Request Logger

**Request Logger** is a Python-based tool designed for logging network requests made by web browsers, utilizing the PyQt5 framework. This project captures and logs essential details about each network request, providing insights into parameters such as:

- **URL**: The endpoint being requested.

- **Response Status**: The status code returned by the server (e.g., 200, 404).
- **Headers**: The HTTP headers associated with the request and response.
- **Request Payload**: Any data sent with the request (if applicable).
- **Ping**: The time taken for the request to receive a response.

## Features
